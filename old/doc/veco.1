.SH NAME
veco \- combine several scalar images into one
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B veco
\fIOPERATION in1 in2 in3 \fR... \fI> out\fR
.br
.B veco
\fIOPERATION in1 in2 in3 \fR... \fI-o out\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Veco combines several scalar images by a pixelwise operation
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-o\fR file
use a named output file instead of stdout
.TP
\fB\-g\fR GOODNESS
use a specific GOODNESS criterion for discarding samples
.TP
\fB\-x\fR NUMS
instead of images, combine the given numbers
.SS "Operations:"
.TP
min
minimum value of the good samples
.TP
max
maximum value of the good samples
.TP
avg
average of the good samples
.TP
sum
sum of the good samples
.TP
med
medoid of the good samples (the central sample, rounding down)
.TP
medv
median of the good samples (average of 1 or 2 central samples)
.TP
mod
mode of the good samples (the value that appears more times)
.TP
cnt
number of good samples
.TP
mul
product of all good samples
.TP
first
the first good sample
.TP
rnd
a randomly chosen good sample
.TP
qX
Xth percentile
.TP
MP
Pth power mean
.TP
FP
Fr??chet typical position, or minimizer of P\-norm (M1=V2, etc)
.TP
LP
P\-Lehmer mean
.TP
GP,Q
Gini's mean with parameters P and Q
.TP
euc
euclidean norm (M2)
.TP
geo
geometric mean (M0)
.TP
har
harmonic mean (M\-1)
.SS "Goodness criteria:"
.TP
numeric
whether the sample is not NAN, this is the default
.TP
finite
whether the sample is a finite number
.TP
always
consider all samples regardless of their value
.TP
nonzero
whether the sample is numeric and not 0 or \fB\-0\fR
.TP
positive
whether the sample is >= 0
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
veco avg i*.png \-o avg.png
Compute the average of a bunch of images
.TP
veco M0 \-x 1 2 3
Compute the geometric mean of three numbers
