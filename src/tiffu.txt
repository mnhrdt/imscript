DATA STRUCTURES FOR LARGE IMAGES
--------------------------------


Abstract

We describe the simplest data structure that allows fast access to
images of size comparable to a whole hard disk, e.g. of terapixel
size.  Thanks to this data structure, portions of the image at any
position and resolution can be extracted instantaneously, allowing
continuous navigation of the scale space.  The data structure is very
simple: each octave of the scale space pyramid is stored as a
collection of small tiles that can be accessed individually.


1. INTRODUCTION

Modern computer systems such as servers, laptops, and smartphones,
store information in two levels:

	TYPE A: RAM memory, with a limited amount of space but very fast to read

	TYPE B: Block storage devices, that can contain a huge amount of data,
	but are slow to access

In reality, the situation is more complicated due to disk and CPU
caches, but we will stick to this simplified model.  According to
this context, we can distinguish three size ranges of image data:

	SMALL: Images that fit comfortably in RAM memory.
	This includes most single-captor images, even very high resolution
	images taken with the largest modern sensors UHDTV and OMNIMAX.

	LARGE: Images that do not fit in RAM memory but fit in disk.
	This includes for example moderately-sized image mosaics and
	push-broom satellite images.

	ARBITRARILY LARGE IMAGES: that do not fit on a single disk.
	This includes databases of multiple images of the same object
	at very different resolutions.

These are sociotechnical distinctions, whose precise definition
depends on the context and the device used.  The goal of this article
is to describe how to deal efficiently with large images, that fit on
disk but do not fit on RAM memory.
