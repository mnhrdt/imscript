SUMMARY
-------

This archive contains an implementation of the algorithm for burst denoising
described on the IPOL paper "How to blend several photographs of a painting
into one".



REQUIREMENTS
------------

A standard Unix or Unix-like environment with a C compiler and the following
libraries:

	* libfftw3
	* libpng
	* libtiff
	* libjpg

Moreover, an external program that computes SIFT keypoints on gray images must
be installed (for example, the executable that can be downloaded from Lowe's
webpage).  The location of this program must be configured inside the file
"bin/graysift.sh".  The provided script "bin/download_lowe_sift.sh" will try to
download this program for linux.



COMPILATION
-----------

Run the "build.sh" script.




TEST
----

First make sure that the compilation has run correctly and that you have
the "bin" subdirectory on your PATH.

The subdirectory "test" contains an example of input data.  Run the simple
script "do_test.sh" inside this directory to run the algorithm on this data.
This script runs eht folllwing two commands:

	burst_registration.sh i%02d.png reg_i%02d.png 0 5
	burst_combination.sh reg_i%02d.png 0 5 denoised.png

The first command produces the images "reg_i*.png", which are registered to the
first one.  The second command produces an image "denoised.png" which is a
weighted linear combination of registered images.

The input and output images are denoted by a printf-like pattern, and their
filenames are internally produced spanning the two given indices.

Several intermediary files are produced, which are useful for visualization.
For example, the files view_opairs_reg_i*.png contain a visaulization of the
SIFT matches between each image and the first one.
