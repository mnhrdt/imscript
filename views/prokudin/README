Some utilities for working with "Prokudin" images


***********
COMPILATION
***********

Running "make" on this directory should compile without problems (tried on
linux and mac, with four different compilers).

It requires a working installation of a C compiler, and the "libpng",
"libtiff", and "libjpeg" libraries.  For displaying the images, it is desirable
to install the imagemagick package.



************************
DESCRIPTION OF EACH TOOL
************************


* cut3 : cut a gray image into three equal height vertical slices

Example: cut3 input.tiff out1.tiff out2.tiff out3.tiff


* join3 : join three gray images of the same size to form a color image

Example: join3 in_red.tiff in_green.tiff in_blue.tiff out_colorized.tiff


* quantize : quantize an image to 8 bits

Example : quantize 0 65000 in.tiff out.png


* translation : apply an integral displacement to an image (filling-in by zero)

Example: translation 10 -20 in.png out.png


* registration : naive algorithm to register two gray images

Example: registration A.tiff B.tiff Btranslated.tiff



*************************
EXAMPLE OF RECONSTRUCTION
*************************

First download a Prokudin glass plate, for example, the one from this address:
http://lcweb2.loc.gov/master/pnp/prok/01000/01043a.tif

Cut the image into three components:

	cut3 01043a.tif red.tiff green.tiff blue.tiff

Check the reconstruction without any registration:

	join3 red.tiff green.tiff blue.tiff test.tiff
	quantize test.tiff test.png
	display test.png

Try a registration computed by hand:
