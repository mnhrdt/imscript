NIPL is Not an Image Processing Library
---------------------------------------

NIPL is a set of conventions for doing image processing in standard C.

The conventions are the following:

1. Conventions for image data:

	1.1. An image is an array of pixels
	1.2. The pixels are ordered from left to right, and from top to bottom
	1.3. A pixel is an array of samples
	1.4. A sample is a numeric C type (typically char or float).
	1.5. All the pixels on an image have the same number of samples
	1.6. This number of samples is arbitrary, it can be 1, 3, or 10 or 1000
	1.7. The samples are numbers, not intensities
	1.8. Pixels are contiguous, never broken (identical to 1.3)
	1.9. Broken pixels (color planes) are represented as arrays of images
	1.10. The "default" format for samples is "float"


2. Coding conventions (based on Linux Kernel coding style)

	2.1. Tabs are 8 spaces
	2.2. Lines have at most 80 columns
	2.3. Functions have at most 25 lines
	2.4. Functions longer than 25 lines are OK if they have some symmetry
	2.7. Structs are never used in the interface of a reusable algorithm
	2.8. Structs are OK for internal implementation details
	2.9. In particular, there is no user-visible image struct
	2.10. Algorithms may use an internal image struct adapted to their needs
	2.11. Global and static variables are frowned upon
	2.13. Void pointers are never explicitly casted to other pointer types
	2.14. Actually, casts are forbidden, use conversion functions
	2.15. Struct typedefs are forbidden, use the structure tag
	2.16. Pointer typedefs are forbidden
	2.17. Typedefs are alowed for complicated function types
	2.18. Typedef are allowed for plain C data types
	2.19. A typedef always ends in "_t"
	2.20. All functions are declared static except for public API functions
	2.21. Order of function arguments: (output, input, options)
	2.22. Exception to 2.21: (state, output, input, options)
	2.23. The ideal internal function:
		* is static
		* has a very long name
		* has two or three single-letter arguments 
		* has none or very few local variables
		* is only called once
	2.24. The ideal interface function:
		* is the only non-static function in its file
		* has a very long name
		* has a few arguments with long names explaining their purpose
		* has many single-letter local variables
		* does not do any actual computation, just passes stuff around

	
2. Naming conventions

	3.1. All C symbols are 100% lowercase
	3.2. All macros are 100% uppercase
	3.3. Function names are very long and descriptive
	3.4. Local variables are typically single letters
	3.5. Struct tags have long and descriptive names
	3.6. Struct fields have short names (preferably single letters)
	3.7. Global and static variables must have very long and obnoxious names
	3.8. Typical names for image arguments: x, y, z, in, out
	3.9. Names for image sizes: w (width), h (height), pd (pixel dimension)
	3.10. Image sizes as arguments go together with their images
	3.11. Example of 3.10:
	     void zoom_out(float *y, int wy, int hy, float *x, int wx, int hx)
