.SH DESCRIPTION
Qeasy quantizes an image into [0,255] using the selected range.
.PP
The image is trasformed by an affine contrast change I \-> a*I + b
and then the colors are saturated and quantized into [0,255].
The parameters (a,b) of the contrast change are computed to statisfy
certain conditions. By default, they are chosen so that 5% of the pixels
are saturated.
