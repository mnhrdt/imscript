.SH NAME
contihist \- compute the continuous histogram of an image
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B contihist
\fI\,NSAMPLES MIN MAX img.png > histo.g\/\fR
.br
.B cat
\fI\,img.png | contihist NSAMPLES MIN MAX > histo.g\/\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Contihist computes the continuous histogram of an image.
.PP
The continuous histogram is defined as the limit histogram of the image
zoomed\-in linearly by an infinite factor.  Thus, the continuous histogram
is a function R\->R that is sampled at NSAMPLES positions between MIN and MAX
to produce the output of this program.
The histogram is printed in a format that can be piped directly to gnuplot.
