.SH DESCRIPTION
Viewflow displays a two\-dimensional vector field using a color.
.PP
i.e. The input is an image with two\-dimensional pixels (i.e. a vector field).
The output is an RGB image of the same size, where each vector is
represented by a different color, according to a two\-dimensional palette.
For most palettes, the hue indicates the direction and the intensity
indicates the magnitude of the vector.
Vectors larger than SATSCALE are "saturated" to the same intensity.
