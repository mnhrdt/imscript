.SH DESCRIPTION
Homwarp resamples an image according to an homography.
.PP
A new image is created whose pixel values are sampled at the positions
specified by an homographic transform.  No fancy filtering is performed,
thus this program is not appropriate for zooming\-out images as it will
introduce a lot of aliasing.
.PP
The only required parameter is HOMOGRAPHY, which is a string that specifies
the homographic transform (either a single string with 8 numbers or a
filename that contains them).  Optionally, the user can also specify the
desired width and height of the output image (by default, the same as the
input image), and the input/output files (by default, stdin/stdout).
