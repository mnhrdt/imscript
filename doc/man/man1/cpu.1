.SH DESCRIPTION
Cpu is an interface for displaying and exploring a list of images.
.PP
This program can be used for image visualization, but this a side\-effect,
just an afterthought.  The main goal of this program is to showcase
a certain philosophy for image processing: an image is an array of numbers,
it can be extrapolated towards the whole plane, and interpolated to
infinite resolution, its the values can be positive, negative, or
d\-dimensional vectors, the size can be 1x1 or 10^5x10^5, and the running
time of each operation depends only on the size of the window.
