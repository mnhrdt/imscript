.SH NAME
vecoh \- pixelwise clustering of scalar images
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B vecoh
\fI\,OPERATION in1 in2 in3 \/\fR... \fI\,> out\/\fR

.B vecoh
\fI\,OPERATION in1 in2 in3 \/\fR... \fI\,-o out\/\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Vecov computes pixelwise clusters defined by several scalar images.
.PP
The input is a collection of scalar (gray\-level) images of the same size.
The output is a single image of 8\-dimensional pixels.  The components of
output pixels are organized as follows:
x[0]=number of modes, x[1]=first mode, x[2]=second mode or NAN, etc.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-o\fR file
use a named output file instead of stdout
.TP
\fB\-x\fR NUMS
instead of images, compute clustering of the given numbers
.SS "Operations:"
.TP
kmeans
shortest vector in euclidean norm
.TP
kmedians
longest vector in euclidean norm
.TP
contrario
average of vectors
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
vecoh avg i*.png \-o avg.png
Compute the average of a bunch of images
