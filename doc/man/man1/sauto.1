.SH NAME
sauto \- render a signed image with color palette
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sauto
\fI\,in.npy out.png\/\fR
.br
.B qauto
\fI\,in.npy > out.pnm\/\fR
.br
.B cat
\fI\,in.npy | qauto > out.pnm\/\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Sauto applies a blue\-white\-red palette to a signed image.
.PP
The image is trasformed by an affine contrast change I \-> a*I + b
and then the colors are saturated and quantized into [0,255].
The parameters (a,b) of the contrast change are computed to statisfy
certain conditions. By default, they are chosen so that 5% of the pixels
are saturated.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-p\fR X
saturate a percentile of X% (default X=1)
.TP
\fB\-s\fR S
saturate at values \fB\-S\fR,S
.TP
\fB\-g\fR
gray scale palette
.TP
\fB\-v\fR
verbose mode (print details of the transformation)
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
display short help message
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display longer help message
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
qauto in.npy out.png
Quantize an image by simplest color balance.
