.SH NAME
bdint \- boundary value interpolation
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bdint
\fI\,in.npy out.npy\/\fR
.br
.B bdint
\fI\,in.npy > out.npy\/\fR
.br
.B cat
\fI\,in.npy | nnint > out.npy\/\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Bdint fills\-in the holes of an image by boundary aggregation.
.PP
The missing pixels are those whose value is NAN.  (Alternatively,
a binary mask image can be given.)  For a color image, each pixel
dimension is treated independently.  Each connected hole is filled\-in
with a constant value, extracted from the boundary of the hole.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-a\fR METHOD
use METHOD interpolation (one of min,max,avg)
.TP
\fB\-m\fR mask.png
use a separate binary mask instead of inline NANs
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
display short help message
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display longer help message
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
bdint \-a avg in.tiff out.tiff
Fill\-in holes by boundary average
.TP
