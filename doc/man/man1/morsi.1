.SH NAME
morsi \- simple gray-scale morphology
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B morsi
\fI\,ELEMENT OPERATION in out\/\fR
.br
.B morsi
\fI\,ELEMENT OPERATION in > out\/\fR

.B cat
\fI\,in | morsi ELEMENT OPERATION > out\/\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Morsi applies a gray\-scale morphological operator to an image.
.PP
You have to specify a structuring element and a morphological operation.
There are no defaults.
.SS "Elements:"
.TP
cross
a cross of 5 pixels
.TP
square
a square of 3x3 pixels
.TP
diskR
a discrete disk of radius R (e.g., disk3.1)
.TP
dyskR
the boundary of a discrete disk of radius R
.TP
hrecW
a rectangle of size Wx1
.TP
vrecH
a rectangle of size 1xH
.TP
drecX
a 45\-degree diagonal of X\-pixels
.TP
DrecX
a \fB\-45\-degree\fR diagonal of X\-pixels
.SS "Operations:"
.TP
erosion
min of neighboring pixels (smooth and darken)
.TP
dilation
max of neighboring pixels (smooth and brighten)
.TP
median
median of neighboring pixels (smooth)
.TP
opening
erosion and dilation (remove small dark spots)
.TP
closing
dilation and erosion (remove small bright spots)
.TP
gradient
dilation minus erosion (find centered boundaries)
.TP
igradient
image minus erosion (inner boundaries)
.TP
egradient
dilation minus image (outer boundaries)
.TP
laplacian
difference between outer and inner grads (signed boundaries)
.TP
enhance
image minus laplacian (sharpen boundaries and details)
.TP
blur
image plus laplacian (centered smoothing, removes deatils)
.TP
tophat
image minus opening (select bright blobs)
.TP
bothat
closing minus image (select dark blobs)
.TP
oscillation
closing minus opening (measure local oscillation)
.TP
iblur
average of image and its erosion (blur towards dark)
.TP
eblur
average of image and its dilation (blur towards light)
.TP
cblur
average of iblur and eblur (detail\-preserving smoothing)
.SH EXAMPLES
