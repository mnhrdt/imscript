.SH DESCRIPTION
Plambda evaluates an expression with images as variables.
.PP
The expression is written in reverse polish notation using common
operators and functions from `math.h'.  The variables appearing on the
expression are assigned to each input image in alphabetical order.
.PP
EXPRESSIONS:
.PP
A "plambda" expression is a sequence of tokens.
Tokens may be constants,
variables, or operators.  Constants and variables get their value
computed and pushed to the stack.  Operators pop values from the stack,
apply a function to them, and push back the results.
.PP
CONSTANTS: numeric constants written in scientific notation, and "pi"
.PP
OPERATORS: +, \-, *, ^, /, <, >, ==, and all the functions from math.h
.PP
LOGIC OPS: if, and, or, not
.PP
VARIABLES: anything not recognized as a constant or operator.  There
must be as many variables as input images, and they are assigned to
images in alphabetical order.  If there are no variables, the input
images are pushed to the stack.
.PP
All operators (unary, binary and ternary) are vectorizable.  Thus, you can
add a scalar to a vector, divide two vectors of the same size, and so on.
The semantics of each operation follows the principle of least surprise.
.PP
Some "sugar" is added to the language:
