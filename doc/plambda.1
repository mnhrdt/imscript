.SH NAME
plambda \- evaluate an expression with images as variables
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B plambda

.br
.B plambda
\fI-c num1 num2 num3  \fR... \fI"EXPRESSION"\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
Plambda evaluates an expression with images as variables.
.PP
The resulting image is printed to standard output.  The expression
should be written in reverse polish notation using common operators
and functions from `math.h'.  The variables appearing on the
expression are assigned to each input image in alphabetical order.
.PP
EXPRESSIONS:
.PP
A "plambda" expression is a sequence of tokens.
Tokens may be constants,
variables, or operators.  Constants and variables get their value
computed and pushed to the stack.  Operators pop values from the stack,
apply a function to them, and push back the results.
.PP
CONSTANTS: numeric constants written in scientific notation, and "pi"
.PP
OPERATORS: +, \-, *, ^, /, and all the functions from math.h
.PP
VARIABLES: anything not recognized as a constant or operator.  There
must be as many variables as input images, and they are assigned to
images in alphabetical order.  If there are no variables, the input
images are pushed to the stack.
.PP
All operators (unary, binary and ternary) are vectorizable.
.PP
Some "sugar" is added to the language:
.SS "Predefined variables (always preceeded by a colon):"
