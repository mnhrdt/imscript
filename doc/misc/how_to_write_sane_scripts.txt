- either your script is executable or its name ends in .sh, but not both
- preferably, use #!/bin/sh, but then assume sh is not bash
- otherwise if you need bash, use #!/bin/bash
- only put a shebang if the file is executable
- if your script is not executable, it can be run with ". file.sh" without ever
  quitting the parent shell
- variable names are uppercase, except maybe if they are single letters
- never store filanemes in variables, filenames *are* variable names
- if you check the existence of files at every line, write a makefile instead
- use always test and short-circuiting, try to avoid if
- to break a pipeline into several lines, put each command on a separate line
- assume that your filenames do not contain spaces.  Otherwise, start your
  script by temporarily renaming the files using saner names.  Do not ever
  use weird quotes to "accept" filenames with spaces.
- this is the basic skeleton of a script

#!/bin/sh

set -x   # set flag to print debugging information
set -e   # set flag to quit on first error

# extract input arguments
if [ $# != "3" ] ; then
	printf "usage:\n\t$0 in1.txt in2.txt out.txt\n" >&2
	exit 1
fi
FNAME_IN1=$1
FNAME_IN2=$2
FNAME_OUT=$3

# copy files into temporary directory
T=`mktemp -d /tmp/myscript.XXXXXX`
cp $FNAME_IN1 $T/a.txt
cp $FNAME_IN2 $T/b.txt
cd $T

# run your computation
transform a.txt b.txt c.txt >oo 2>oe

# recover the result
cd -
cp $T/c.txt $FNAME_OUT
