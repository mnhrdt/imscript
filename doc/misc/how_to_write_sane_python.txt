How to write sane Python
------------------------


BASIC HYGIENE

H1. print a copy of PEP8 and burn it unceremoniously
H2. require at least python 3.6.  Previous versions are unusable.
H3. process strings with % or with f-interpolation;  do not use .format
H4. try to ignore the existence of exceptions as much as possible
H5. avoid any kind of boilerplate that helps for 2.7 compatibility
H6. avoid brain-damaged stuff like type annotation imports


NAMING

N1. local variables are single letters.  No exceptions.
N2. use unicode letters without fear: α, β, γ instead of alpha, beta, gamma
N3. function names are long and descriptive
N4. global variables have long and uppercase names
N5. do not bring new mixed-case symbols into the world
N6. either your file is executable or its name ends in .py, but not both
N7. arguments cannot have the same name as values:  avoid "f(x=x)"
N8. functions cannot have the same name as modules: avoid "foo.foo"
N9. functions cannot have the same name as modules: avoid "from foo import foo"


FORMATTING

F1. indent with 1 tab per indentation level
F2. max 80 characters per line (1 indent counts as 8)
F3. max 25 lines per function
F4. max 8 local variables per scope
F5. strings are always quoted "like this", ...
F6. ... except when they are dictionary keys, which are quoted 'thusly'


COMMENTS

C1. write a single-line comment for each variable, explaining its meaning
C2. write a few lines of comment to document each function
C3. docstrings are used only for functions intended to be used in another file
C4. the docstring does not replace the comment associated to the function.  It
    serves a very different purpose: The docstring is to be read by people who
    only want to use your function but do not care about the implementaiton.
    The comment is to be read by the person who implements the function, and
    it often explains how the function relates to the other pieces of the code.
C5. do not put any licensing/copyright boilerplate at the top of the file
    (if it is really necessary, put it at the bottom of the file)



IMPORTING

I1. strive to minimize the number of imports
I2. consider unused imports syntax errors
I3. imports should be as local as possible (e.g., inside a function)
I4. unless your script has code at level 0, global imports are prohibited
I5. Comparison of importing styles:
    BAD: import package as pk         # your code becomes un-copypasteable
    GOOD: import package              # code is clear (but may be too verbose)
    BEST: from package import fu bar  # useful for short and function-heavy code


EXPORTING

E1. do not export visibility of dependencies
E2. do not export visibility of unnecessary functions
E3. each exported function must have a comprehensive docstring
E4. consider un-documented exported functions syntax errors
E5. use sys.modules[__name__] = foo to avoid foo.foo stupidity


USAGE

U1. use string interpolation instead of concatenation
U2. avoid os.path.join, use string processing instead
U3. in numpy, never use .dot, use always @
U4. use matplotlib for plots, but do not EVER use it for displaying an image
U5. tkinter is there, and is useful, and is simple; do not be afraid of it
U6. represent graphs as sparse matrices, not as dictionaries
U7. avoid json, toml, yaml and all that shit: use text files and parse them


SHELL ENVIRONEMENT

S1. rm -rf ~/.local ; touch ~/.local ; chmod 000 ~/.local # once and for all
S2. mkdir -p ~/local/{bin,share/python,dotlocal}
S3. export PATH=~/local/bin:~/local/share/python/bin:/bin
S4. export PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1
S5. export PYTHONUSERBASE=~/local/share/python
S6. export XDG_DATA_HOME=~/local/share/dotlocal
S7. python -m pip config set global.break-system-packages true # allow local pip
S8. pip install shit  # only affects your local user
S9. delete $PYTHONUSERBASE regularly and re-install packages as the need arises
S10. do not use virtualenvs


MATH

M1. (Remember N1) Local variable names are single letters.  No exceptions.
M2. (Remember N2) Do not fear unicode: from math import pi as π
M3. (Remember I1) Do not use global imports.  Write functions that import what
    they need to perform their computation.
M4. Use dependencies "implicitly": For example, you do not need to import numpy
    to do most things with numpy arrays.  You just need an external function
    that returns numpy arrays, and work from there using method functions of the
    array class.  This has the advantage that if your arrays become of another
    type (with a compatible interface), you do not need to change anything.  For
    example, most linear algebra code can be written to work transparently with
    numpy arrays, sparse matrices, etc.  If you are careful, the same numerical
    code can work with numpy, torch and jax arrays without ever mentioning them.


TYPING

T1. No


PACKAGING

P1. your program should be easily usable without need to "install" it
P2. ideal case: "wget url://to/myprogram.py ; python myprogram.py"
P3. do not force installation of non-essential dependencies.  If your program
    requires a dependency just for a small, optional feature, allow to install
    it and let it fail at runtime if the dependency is found missing.
P4. pip sucks; but conda, uv, poetry are orders of magnitude worse: avoid them!
P5. jupyter notebooks are great for literate programming, but the .ipynb file
    format is horrific.  Use jupytext to distribute your notebooks as plain
    python files.  Check that you can run your notebook by invoking it
    explicitly from the shell: "python notebook.py".  Do away with the .ipynb
    files entirely.
